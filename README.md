## Resources
- This api *will* allow users to add 5 urls to monitorate its availability.
- The api *will* send notify (by SMS) if any of those resources go down or come back up.
- Twilio API is *going to be* used to send these messages, so this aplication will be connected to a 3rd party API (but still won't be using any library).

## Changes
- During the implementation several changes were made to make the code cleaner.
